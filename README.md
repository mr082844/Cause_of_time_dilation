# Investigations into Universal Specificity:
These investigations into the theory of universal specificity found a proper conception of time missed in common practice (see investigation 1); which led to the realization that a universally stationary frame (USF) must exist to avoid violating the law of identity (see investigation 1); which led to the discovery that for any inertial reference frame the average effective speed of light, c0, is equal in all directions, but less than or equal to c, and only appears to be c because of time dilation (see investigation 2); which led to discovering that specific work causes kinetic time dilation (see investigation 3); which led to revisiting the relativistic kinetic energy and total energy model (see investigation 4); which led to the discovery that a time dilation gradient causes a specific force we call gravity (see investigation 5); which led to the integration between gravitational and kinetic time dilation into total time dilation, and an updated total energy model comprised of internal, kinetic and potential energy (see investigation 6); which finally culminated into a theoretical experiment able to determine which frame is the USF (see investigation 7), and a theory of everything that is light (see investigation 8).

...all because of a proper conception of time.

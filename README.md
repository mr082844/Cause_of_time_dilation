# Investigations_into_Universal_Specificity
These investigations into the theory of universal specificity (or specificity for short) found a proper conception of time missed in common practice; which led to the realization that a universally stationary frame (USF) must exist to avoid violating the law of identity; which led to the discovery that for any inertial reference frame the average effective speed of light, c0, is equal in all directions, but less than or equal to c; which led to discovering the cause of kinetic time dilation; which led to revisiting the relativistic kinetic energy and total energy model; which led to the discovery that a time dilation gradient causes a specific force we call gravity; which led to the integration between gravitational and kinetic time dilation into total time dilation, and an updated total energy model comprised of internal, kinetic and potential energy; which finally culminated into a theoretical experiment able to determine which frame is the USF, and a theory of everything that is light.

...all because of a proper conception of time.
